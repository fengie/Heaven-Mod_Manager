# Bug Precedents

This file is the canonical defect-prevention ledger for the MHW project. It is mandatory training material.

Every discovered bug/regression/process escape must produce or update an entry here before the work is considered complete. Entries are not blame records; they are durable engineering controls. Future agents must read materially relevant precedents before changing the same subsystem.

## 2026-09-29 — repository-wide — escaped bugs require durable prevention controls
- **Symptom:** User-facing and engineering bugs were still able to appear after agent-authored work, despite substantial verification rules.
- **Root cause:** The governance model emphasized fixing and verifying individual tasks, but did not make every escaped bug automatically create a durable precedent, guideline update, and regression-prevention control.
- **Violated invariant / wrong assumption:** A successful local fix or passing existing test suite was treated as sufficient closure even when the defect exposed a missing invariant, test class, or process guard.
- **Why prior defenses missed it:** Lessons could remain task-local, in chat, or in a one-off fix instead of being propagated into mandatory training and mechanically enforceable checks.
- **Direct fix:** Added the mandatory bug-prevention and precedent protocol to `AGENTS.md` and made this ledger mandatory training material.
- **Preventive rule/process change:** Every bug now requires the closure chain: bug → root cause → precedent log → guideline/process change → regression coverage → verification evidence → propagation.
- **Regression coverage added/strengthened:** Governance now requires automated regression coverage whenever practical and stronger deterministic verification when automation is not feasible; reviewers must reject fixes that skip the chain.
- **Verification evidence/environment:** Repository governance files updated directly on canonical `main`; follow-up fetch/inspection required after writes.
- **Sibling/adjacent cases checked:** Applies repository-wide to product bugs, updater/install defects, UI/runtime regressions, integration failures, false completion claims, and agent/process failures.
- **References (SHA/PR/issue/log):** Governance commits created on 2026-09-29.
