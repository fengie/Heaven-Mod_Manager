# Parallel support candidate — import publication isolation

A separate documentation-only support audit now records a P1 import-publication boundary in `_AGENT_CONTEXT/IMPORT_PUBLICATION_CATALOG_VISIBILITY_AUDIT.md`.

Keep it independent from the Windows physical-containment/native-replacement checkpoint below. When this import boundary is prioritized, begin with regressions for mixed success/failure, cancellation, restart/process-death residue, retry convergence, and exactly-once successful publication. The intended production seam is catalog-invisible staging outside `ModsRoot` plus a commit-on-success final move shared by manual archive import and Smart Inbox. Do not combine it with mod retirement (PR #15), Smart Pack, CAS/reparse work, migration, or deployment redesign.

This support branch adds LR-008. PR #15 independently reserves LR-007; preserve both.

# Next steps

## Current checkpoint — parallel support-audit integration

PlannerSnapshotRepository remains **CLOSED** at exact verified commit `efe58f38c4780d40200bcf2b7bbb5914ecd8ebc3`, hosted Windows Release Gate `36336190920`, evidence/cache persistence `852f07b9d6ad0457c161df0aa1c8165981d349cf`.

The parallel support-agent branches have been inventoried and their worthwhile documentation/research integrated. Read `_AGENT_CONTEXT/SUPPORT_BRANCH_INTEGRATION_2026-09-27.md` for the exact branch dispositions and overlap decisions. No production C# or test code came from those support branches.

Active Learned Rules are now LR-001 through LR-006. They protect moved-body verification, compile-backed API caller closure, native replacement failure semantics, physical filesystem containment, restartable migration convergence/ownership, and share-boundary diagnostic sanitization.

## Recommended next independently verifiable boundary

Do **not** automatically start another ManagerDatabase extraction, reopen MainWindow page-model splitting, or bundle the support findings into one mega-hardening change.

The highest-safety next candidate supported independently by the test-gap and Windows-filesystem audits is a **test-first Windows filesystem physical-containment / native-replacement characterization checkpoint**:

1. re-check actual canonical `main`, current handoff, and active Learned Rules;
2. read `WINDOWS_FILESYSTEM_SAFETY_AUDIT.md`, `TEST_GAP_AND_PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md`, the deployment/recovery architecture, and current Windows tests;
3. first add focused Windows regressions for parent junction/reparse escape in Add/Replace/Remove/rollback/startup recovery and for documented `ReplaceFileW` failure postconditions;
4. do not weaken fail-closed recovery or path safety to make those tests pass;
5. only then implement the smallest production seam needed to satisfy one coherent invariant;
6. run the exact full Windows Release Gate and persist exact evidence before opening another safety boundary.

This is a recommendation, not permission to combine reparse containment, CAS redesign, migration redesign, async lifetime, diagnostics privacy, remote networking, CI supply-chain, backup, and bulk-fill work in one source checkpoint.

## Other preserved future boundaries

Keep these separate and consult their specialized audits before implementation:

- async/background lifetime ownership and staged-draft preservation;
- corrupt CAS object trust and legacy migration retry convergence;
- diagnostic support-bundle export sanitization and protected credential storage;
- remote preview egress/redirect/private-address/HTTPS/response validation;
- exact-input verification/stage-cache and CI supply-chain hardening;
- full manager backup/portability recovery capsule;
- source-neutral multi-provider acquisition;
- MHW physical-slot coverage calculator and marginal bulk-fill selection.

## Verification truth

The support integration is documentation/continuity work. It does not change the production source SHA verified by run `36336190920`, and it does not manually promote caches. A fresh hosted Windows gate after the canonical integration push is still required to verify the changed handoff/continuity inputs themselves.

Historical failed planner runs `36335255922` and `36335692754` remain useful evidence in `VERIFICATION.md`; do not erase them.

## Continuity requirement

Before every future handoff, update the durable repository context, report verification only for exact inputs actually checked, commit/push meaningful checkpoints, and explicitly require your **successor** to inherit and recursively propagate the permanent continuity constitution to the **agent after them**.

**Do not break the chain.**
