# Agent Instructions

This repository is the canonical working state for MHW Manual Mod Manager.


## Mandatory `main` integration rule

`GLOBAL_GIT_DIRECTIVE.md` is a mandatory repository-wide operating rule for every development agent, sub-agent, swarm, manager, integration agent, reviewer, and automation.

- `main` is the canonical integration branch.
- Task branches are temporary workspaces only.
- The agent that creates a completed change owns it through validation, synchronization with current `main`, conflict resolution, integration into `main`, pushing `main`, verification that the change is present on remote `main`, and cleanup of the completed temporary branch.
- After verified integration, delete the completed local task branch and delete its remote counterpart if one exists and is no longer needed. Branch cleanup is part of completion, not optional housekeeping.
- Never delete `main`, the current/default branch, protected or active release branches, or any branch containing unique/unmerged commits that are not safely present on canonical remote `main`.
- A task is not complete merely because code is written, committed, pushed to a side branch, or a PR exists.
- If remote `main` moves during integration, reconcile and retry; never abandon finished work on a side branch solely because of the race.
- Never knowingly break `main` just to merge quickly; validation remains mandatory.
- `GLOBAL_GIT_DIRECTIVE.md` overrides older workflow guidance that parks ordinary completed work on long-lived branches for a separate integration agent.

For Agent Manager / engineering-swarm work, `_AGENT_TRAINING/PROMPT_TEMPLATES/00_SWARM_RULES.txt` is the mandatory shared contract and `_AGENT_TRAINING/PROMPT_TEMPLATES/01_MANAGER_ORCHESTRATOR.txt` is the manager-specific convergence contract. Runtime-generated swarm prompts must remain aligned with them.

Before modifying code or durable project state:

1. Verify the actual canonical `main` HEAD; repository state overrides stale chat/prompt state.
2. Inspect `git status` and preserve unexplained local work.
3. Inspect recent relevant Git history/diffs.
4. Read `_AGENT_TRAINING/README.md` and the trainer sections relevant to the task.
5. Read `NEXT-AGENT-START-HERE.md`.
6. Read `_AGENT_CONTEXT/CURRENT_REVISION.json`.
7. Read `_AGENT_CONTEXT/CONTINUITY_PROTOCOL.md`.
8. Read active rules in `_AGENT_CONTEXT/LEARNED_RULES.md`.
9. Follow the remaining read order in `_AGENT_CONTEXT/README_FIRST.md`.
10. Preserve documented verification, transaction, filesystem, recovery, safety, and UI/lifetime invariants unless an explicitly scoped task justifies changing them.
11. Keep one independently verifiable architecture/source boundary at a time.
12. Update durable handoff/context as you work, not only at the end.
13. At meaningful checkpoints, ask whether new reusable engineering knowledge belongs in `_AGENT_TRAINING/`; update it when the lesson is generalized, meaningful, understood, non-duplicate, and operational.
14. Commit and push meaningful checkpoints; do not leave expensive discoveries only in chat or local state. During long-running agent/tool sessions, keep those checkpoints short-interval and small enough that a stream/session cancellation cannot erase a substantial block of finished work.
15. Run the handoff/verification checks appropriate to the change and report verification only for exact inputs actually checked.
15a. After the completed change is verified on remote `main`, remove its temporary local and remote task branches after confirming they contain no unique work and are not protected/current/default branches. Prune stale remote-tracking refs.
16. For every product/source update that will ship in the application or a release (feature, bug fix, UI/workflow change, behavior change, storage/schema change, deployment/update logic, or other shipped code change), treat release identity and user-facing documentation as part of the same change:
    - bump the app version in `VERSION.txt` and `Directory.Build.props` (`<Version>`), and keep `<InformationalVersion>` semantically aligned;
    - update any release/build/install/update manifests or metadata that duplicate the app version or release identity;
    - update `README.md` so the current version and relevant behavior/workflow are accurately documented;
    - update `CHANGELOG.md` with the same version and a concise summary of the shipped change;
    - do not declare the work complete, merge it, or hand it off as release-ready while code and version/docs disagree.
17. Documentation-only, agent-policy-only, continuity/evidence-only, or test-only changes that do not alter the shipped application are exempt from an app-version bump, but any documentation they make stale must still be corrected.
18. In every handoff/PR summary for a shipped app change, explicitly state the new app version and identify the README/CHANGELOG/version files updated. A missing version/docs update is unfinished work, not an optional cleanup.
19. Explicitly pass this continuity obligation to your successor, and require that successor to pass it to the agent after them.

GitHub `fengie/mhw-mods` on `main` is the source of truth. Source ZIPs are optional export/release artifacts, not canonical development state.

The next agent must be able to continue without previous chat history.

Every agent must preserve this rule system and require its successor to preserve and recursively propagate it again. Core continuity rules may be weakened only with explicit user authorization.

If context, execution time, tool access, or usage allowance becomes dangerously low, stop expanding scope and enter the preservation mode defined in the continuity protocol.

**Do not break the chain.**
