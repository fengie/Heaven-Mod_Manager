# Learned Rules — append-only agent ledger

Core Rules live in `_AGENT_CONTEXT/CONTINUITY_PROTOCOL.md`. This file records durable, incident-driven rules discovered while working on `fengie/mhw-mods`.

## Ledger discipline

- Preserve append-only history; do not silently erase old rules.
- Status is `Active` or `Superseded`.
- When replacing a rule, add the replacement and mark/link the old rule as Superseded.
- Add a rule only when a concrete incident or discovery makes recurrence likely and the rule materially improves correctness, safety, or engineering time.
- Do not add session-specific observations or duplicate Core Rules.
- Learned Rules may extend Core Rules but may never weaken or contradict them.

Each rule records: Rule ID, status, date, scope, rule, trigger/evidence, rationale, enforcement, relevant commit/run when useful, and supersession links.

## LR-001 — moved production bodies require verification-instrumentation re-audit

- **Rule ID:** LR-001
- **Status:** Active
- **Date:** 2026-09-27
- **Scope:** Production C# moves/extractions and function verification
- **Rule:** When a production method/body is moved, extracted, or materially regenerated, re-audit its required `MasterDebugLog.BeginMethod()` entry instrumentation and resulting function fingerprint/call-site coverage before treating the slice as verification-ready.
- **Trigger / evidence:** Hosted Windows run `36330808544` reached 24/25 and found exactly one missing trace in moved `MainWindowViewModel.ScanInstalledGames()`, leaving seven explicit call sites uncovered. Production fix `fdbe9b71f29b1c4c7d9fcd061a23c2ca75fa3e34` restored the trace; run `36331057943` later closed the slice.
- **Rationale:** A behavior-preserving move can create a new verification fingerprint and lose required runtime instrumentation even when method logic is unchanged.
- **Enforcement:** Review moved/new production bodies during each one-seam checkpoint; preserve function-verifier regression coverage; never manually promote verification caches.
- **Relevant commit/run:** `fdbe9b71f29b1c4c7d9fcd061a23c2ca75fa3e34`; runs `36330808544`, `36331057943`
- **Supersedes:** none
- **Superseded by:** none
